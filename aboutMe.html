    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="about">
        <p>Hi! I'm Harshika Malhotra, a first-year student at the IOI CS+AI program and also pursuing the IITM BS degree in Data Science. I’m passionate about solving problems with code and building meaningful web and AI-based projects. <br> I’ve worked with programming languages like C and Java, and I’m actively learning Data Structures, Web Development, and AI. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, creating UI designs, and improving my logic through coding challenges. <br> My goal is to grow as a developer and collaborate with others to build impactful solutions. Whether it's a solo project or a team hackathon, I love turning ideas into working applications. <br> Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
